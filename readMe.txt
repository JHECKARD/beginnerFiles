Prj_4.0Final is a recreation of Ludo / Parcheesi in Python and
 Pygame.  This game was built in Python 3.0.  
It uses a non-standard dice generator that requires knowledge of
 President months of birth and monthly inflation rates for the years 1914 and 1918.  

Limiting resources and abusing knowledge of resources (values which have the ability to roll a 6) were required elements of game design.

My role was dice generator programmer and designer for this project.

PRJ_5.0 is similar in design to the Ludo / Parcheesi project in 
 Python and Pygame.  This game was built in Python 3.0.  
It uses a non-standard dice generator that requires knowledge of
 President months of birth and monthly inflation rates for the years 1914 and 1918.  Monthly temperatures of Austin, TX and 
birth months of famous scientists were added for this project.  

Instead of the dice roll determining how far the player moves, 
the dice generator grants the player a number of "action points" 
to move around the board.  Zones in the board are stored in a 
1-D array, and the player moves 'left' or 'right' along the 
array, which approximates moving back and forth between 
nearby zones.  Each zone can be Captured for a certain number of 
action points and grants a certain number of Victory Points 
(the number of action points and the number of Victory Points 
may not be the same).  The first player to gain 10 Victory 
Points wins the game.

Limiting resources and abusing knowledge of resources (values which have the ability to roll a 6) were required elements of game design.

My role was dice generator programmer (continued) and win 
condition designer for this project.
